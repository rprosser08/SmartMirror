# SmartMirror_v2

## Project Description
This code is for the GUI component of a smart mirror. It will include the current time and date, and the hourly weather forecast (next 5 hours).

## Instructions
Once you clone this git repository you will need to set a couple of things up. Firstly, you will need to create a free account with Accuweather to use their API. Once you have recieved an API key you can enter it into the provided "APIKeyExample.txt" file, which you will want to rename to "APIKey.txt". 

Finally, you will run the code from the startScreen.py file and enter in your zip code on the start screen and press enter.

## TODO
- Formatting the user screens
- Looking into a bug where the weather API doesn't send the updated data
